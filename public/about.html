<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Mohamed Ashraf, a dentist with a special interest in orthodontics and smile aesthetics.
I love understanding how small details can create big transformations for patients.</p>

<p>When I am not working, you will usually find me gaming—it is my way to unwind and compete.
I am also a football lover, always connected to the sport whether I am watching or playing.</p>

<p>My curiosity does not stop at dentistry; I am currently learning coding and enjoying every step.
Technology, creativity, and problem-solving are things I naturally gravitate toward.
I am passionate about growing, discovering new fields, and challenging myself.</p>

<p>This website is my space to share my journey, my work, and the things I love.
Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me.</p>
